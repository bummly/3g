<span class="first-letter">I</span>n freelance writing, there is no one “right” way to land clients.

I say this with confidence because in my two-plus years as a freelance writer, I’ve found clients in every way possible. From cold pitching, job boards, networking, social media, referrals, Upwork, you name it… I’ve probably done it.<br><br>

But the reason I’ve landed clients with so many different pitch methods is that I was clear in who I wanted to work with first. I was intentional with my actions and it attracted the clients I wanted into my business.

Looking back, I realized it wasn’t luck… it was consistently doing three steps that helped me land client after client. And you can do it too.
